## 1. Introduction

**CLT4BP** (*Cognitive Load Theory for Best Practice*) is an intelligent educational platform that combines **Cognitive Load Theory (CLT)** with the **4C/ID** (Four-Component Instructional Design) instructional design model to generate AI-assisted personalized learning materials.

### What does the system do?

The system allows Instructors to:

- Create and manage courses with structured learning objectives.
- Apply standardized assessments to measure students' cognitive load, motivation, and learning strategies.
- Automatically generate individual and group learning profiles.
- Select CLT effects appropriate for the course context.
- Generate cognitively optimized instructional materials with the help of AI (Claude by Anthropic).
